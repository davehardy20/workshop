# Introduction


Small sample of publicly available Packet Captures that I've used or come across :) These captures are awesome for testing and playing with Security Onion.

They're all free and open to the public so I don't think I'm violating any license uploading them to here. To be clear, they are not my creation! I just put them up here so I could download them via "git clone" and so others can easily download pcaps for workshops etc.

I've tried to give full credit where possible.

## Description


This section of the repo contains a sample of the pcaps and scripts hopefully suitable for Security Onion for Doug :)

The scripts have been converted to work with pcaps located in `/opt/samples/markofu`.

- `trep.sh` replays all pcaps in `/opt/samples/markofu`.

- `trep_simp.sh` is interactive and replays individual pcaps in `/opt/samples/markofu`.

The passwords for both captures is "infected" and that should be hint that they may not be _safe_ :) Enjoy!
