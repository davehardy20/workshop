# BSides London 2013 Workshop

The intention of this workshop is to introduce the ``Security Onion`` Linux distro to workshop attendees and show how it can be used to greatly facilitate incident and attack analysis, by enhancing the visiblity into your network.

## What you have to do :)

*Before BSides*

- Please read the `INSTRUCTIONS.MD` file in the same directory (as this file) of this repository.

*At BSides*

- Have your laptop ready

- We only have an hour so try to be on time

- Ask questions

- The workshop will be based on this presentation - http://is.gd/m5MLqB.

- The workshop will involve:

-- Short history of the history and goals of the `Security Onion` Project

-- Quick description of a sample infrastructure

-- Walkthrough of the tools

-- Practical usage of the tools, primarily due to replaying the packet captures in this github repository with tcpreplay

-- I'd like to use a DVWA installation on the same VM as `Security Onion` to show some alerts happening in real-time but I'm not sure if we'll have time.

*After Bsides* 

- Spread the word about `Security Onion`

- Continue playing with `Security Onion`

- Give thanks to Doug Burks, Scott Runnels and the many other various folk who help with `Security Onion`!
