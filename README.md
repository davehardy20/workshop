Packet Captures for Workshop.


It is important to note that this packet captures have not been created by me but are free to use and so I plan to use them occasionally for workshops (though have not yet).

Like the pcaps being free to use, this repo is free to clone and no notification is required. I hope to use this repo to showcase the beauty of Security Onion and it's smaller in size than my "pcaps" and so quicker to download.
