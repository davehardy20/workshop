Packet Captures for BSides Workshop.

It is important to note that this packet captures have not been created by me but are free to use and so I plan to use them occasionally for workshops (though have not yet).

Like the pcaps being free to use, this repo is free to clone and no notification is required. I hope to use this repo to showcase the beauty of Security Onion and it's smaller in size than my "pcaps" and so quicker to download.

Tasks
-----

*Before BSides*

Please follow these steps prior to the BSides London 2013 workshop:

- Install Security Onion on your laptop (use VirtuaBox, VMware, Parrels...whatever you want).

-- You need to use an Ubuntu-based Linux distro

-- Full Installation instructions can be found at https://code.google.com/p/security-onion/wiki/Installation

-- I have written a simple bash script that will install Security Onion on your Ubuntu VM. It can be found at https://github.com/markofu/scripts/tree/master/so/install.sh.


*At BSides*

- Have your laptop ready

- We only have an hour so try to be on time

- Ask questions

- The workshop will be based on this presentation - http://is.gd/m5MLqB.

- The workshop will involve:

-- Short history of the history and goals of the Security Onion Project

-- Quick description of a sample infrastructure

-- Walkthrough of the tools

-- Practical usage of the tools, primarily due to replaying the packet captures in this github repository with tcpreplay

*After Bsides* 

- Spread the word about Security Onion

- Continue playing with Security Onion

- Give thanks to Doug Burks, Scott Runnels and the various folk who help with Security Onion!
