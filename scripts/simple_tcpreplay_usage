File Detailing Usage for `tcpreplay` during this Workshop.

Use `tcpreplay` to replay newdat3.log (pcap from HN1, one of the Honeynet Captures) onto your "eth0/eth1/eth2"" interface (you may 
need/want to use a different interface, just make sure it's one that's being monitored by Sguil).

Sample:

                `sudo tcpreplay -i eth0 -t newdat3.log`

And then watch the packets hit Sgui, Snorby etc.
